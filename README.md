Understanding Data Trends

Overview of Project: Showing Louise trends and insights from various types of Kickstarter's campaings in order to help her kickstart her own theatre campaign.


#### Analysis and Challenges: Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered

After seeing Louise's play Fever come so close to being realized, I decided to look into other plays with different results and release dates. A few conclusions can be drawn after studying some of the data.

#### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?

There appears to be a trend toward effective campaigns in May-June-July, with reduced success rates in January-February and August-September-October, with the lowest rates in December. As a result, commencing a theatre promotion in the summertime has the highest success percentage compared to other seasons of the year.

#### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

If the Campaign objective is less than $20,000, theatre productions have a 50 percent probability of being successful. The success percentage, on the other hand, rises as the Campaign target is lowered. If the Campaign target is $5000, for example, the percentage rises to around 60%. If the Campaign objective is in the $1000 area, it can rise to around 75%. As a result, a theatre play campaign that maintains its campaign aims as narrow as possible may have a better chance of succeeding. As a result, the larger the campaign objective, such as $25,000 or more, the more likely it is that it will fail.


#### What are some limitations of this dataset?

Because the most recent campaign occurred in 2017, there is a dearth of recent statistics. Recent data can assist with better identifying current patterns in successful Kickstarter data. Furthermore, more data in the parent category theatre and subcategory plays would show a stronger outcome prediction, and perhaps even distinctions in the plays category, such as comedies and tragedies, would show specific traction towards types of plays that tend to attract more attention/donations.

#### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

More raw data from various sites, such as IndieGoGo, would also aid in the creation of deeper studies, because the more data the better. Another component might be a specific dataset that determines how much social outreach a campaign undertakes, such as the number of ads or tweets, which could indicate that efforts that reach out more have greater success rates.
