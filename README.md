After looking at the data chart for when Campaigns were created and ended, there seems to be a trend for successful campaigns in the months of May-June-July, and lower success rates falling in Jan-Feb and Aug-Sep-Oct, with the lowest rates in December. Therefore, one might consider starting a theatre campaign in Summertime as that suggests the highest success rate over other times of the year.
